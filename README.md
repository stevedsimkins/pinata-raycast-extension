# Pinata

Welcome to the Pinata Raycast Extension! Pinata is the premire web3 media solution, helping users upload, share, and own their content. This extension is to give you just one more way to access Pinata's services. To get started, sign up for a free account at [Pinata.cloud](https://app.pinata.cloud/signup). 

After that the extension will need a few things. 

## Pinata API JWT

In order to access your Pinata account you will need to paste in your Pinata API key JWT. You can follow the guide [here]() to get that! 

## Submarine Key

To use the Pinata Submarining feature you'll also need to enter your Submarine API key. Guide on how to do that can be found [here]()!

## Gateway 

If you want to see your files or generate links for your files, you will need to enter in an IPFS Gateway of your choice. We would recommend your [Dedicated Gateway]() which can be found [here](), however you can also use a public gateway like ```https://gateway.pinata.cloud```. Just keep in mind that public gateways are slower and are subject to rate limiting! 

## Enjoy!
